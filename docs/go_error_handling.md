# Error handling in Go

Example of how to handle errors

```go
import (
	"github.com/cockroachdb/errors"
	"github.com/rs/zerolog/log"
)

func main() {
	err := doSomeCalculations()
	if err != nil {
		// This is the top level, log the problem. Can include words such as "error, problem with x, failed, etc"
		// Use zerolog and not fmt or log packages
    log.Error().Err(err).Msg("Problem doing some calculations")
		return
	}
}

func doSomeCalculations() error {
	result, err := divide(4, 0)
	if err != nil {

		// if you want to detect and respond to specific error conditions use errors.Is or errors.As
		// errors.Is checks the VALUE of the error matches, errors.As checks that the TYPE of the error is the same
		// In this example, the error we want to check for is a generic error value so we can't use errors.As and have to use errors.Is
    // If you want calling code to be able to easily respond to specific errors it would be better to create a dedicated error type and use errors.As
    var divideByZero = errors.New("Divide by zero")
		if errors.Is(err, divideByZero) {
			log.Debug().Msg("We have had another one of those pesky divide by zero errors")
		}
		// Bubble up error to caller. No need to log, the caller will either log OR bubble it up further with it's own Wrap
		// No need for words like "error, problem with x. Just give context to what was just attempted"
		return errors.Wrap(err, "Running division")
	}
	log.Debug().Msgf("Result was: %v", result)
	return nil
}

func divide(first int, second int) (int, error) {
	if second == 0 {
		// If we don't have an err to Wrap such as in this example create a new error describing what the error is and send it to caller.
		// No need to log as we are sending error back
		// When returning error, set the return value to it's zero value which for int is zero and string would be "" etc etc
		return 0, errors.New("Divide by zero")
	}
  // Explicitly return nil when there is no error
	return first / second, nil
}
```

The output of the above program:

```json
{"level":"debug","time":"2022-10-17T17:13:17+01:00","message":"We have had another one of those pesky divide by zero errors"}
{"level":"error","error":"Running division: Divide by zero","time":"2022-10-17T17:13:17+01:00","message":"Problem doing some calculations"}
```

Using the above lines, we can determine not only what went wrong but also the path the execution took through the code.
